.SH NAME
ticrypt-spank \- Slurm spank plugin for ticrypt node reconfiguration
.SH SYNOPSIS

  Install the ticrypt.so Spank plugin and job_submit_ticrypt.so plugin

  Include in plugstack.conf for Slurm

  Configure /etc/ticrypt-spank.conf with convert and revert commands

  Add ticrypt to JobSubmitPlugins in slurm.conf

  Run a Slurm job with --ticrypt

.SH DESCRIPTION
ticrypt-spank provides ticrypt.so spank plugin and ticrypt job submit plugin for Slurm. This spank plugin provides the --ticrypt Slurm option and mechanism to call commands for converting a standard compute node to a ticrypt vm controller. Actual conversion is site specific and requires a site module program to be deployed and referenced in ticrypt-spank.conf. The job submit plugin ensures ticrypt-spank.conf ACLs and feature requirements are honored and a single task per node layout. 

In the event of failed conversion, the node is marked to DRAIN in Slurm and an attempt is made to requeue the calling job. The ability to requeue a job is dependent on the jobs options and site configuration, namely Slurm's JobRequeue option. In the case where revert fails during job task end, the node is also set to DRAIN but the job is not requeued.

.SH OPTIONS
Provided Slurm Options:
  --ticrypt             request a ticrypt node re-configuration for job

Configuration File: /etc/ticrypt-spank.conf 
  convert:    "/some/command/to_convert --options"
  revert:     "/some/command/to_revert  --options"
  drain:      boolean indicating if nodes should be drained on a convert or revert failure
  requeue:    boolean indicating if spank should try to requeue a job where conversion failed
  partitions: array of allowed partitions for ticrypt jobs
  features:   array of required features ticrypt jobs must request
  accounts:   array of accounts allowed to utilize plugin
